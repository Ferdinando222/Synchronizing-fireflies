# Synchronizing-fireflies
A simple project made with processing to simulate the synchronization of fireflies based on Kouramoto model of coupled oscillators

For more information about Kouramoto model following the Wikipedia link

Next features to develop:
-add a synth in order to reproduce sounds
-develop a better implementation of the equation (with more parameters)
